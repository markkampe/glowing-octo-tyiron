POINT OF ORDER
	Review everything to segregate these into ceph put-backs
	and WuShan simulations (that will probably never happen)
	Do right by Ceph and then put Glowing Octo to bed)

JUST DO IT

	most test functions are now obsolete
		confirm each
		mutatis mutandum those that don't yet
		delete obsolete modules from glow
		delete obsolete modules from wip-perf-model

	SimFS
		add CPU parameter so we can scale those costs too

	Gui
		import sys; query sys.version_info to include tkintr/TKintr

	SimDisk returns <l,b,L>

	test
		random/seq controlled by dictionary (<-ceph)
		make sure that report output for creates/deletes is obviously ops/sec (->ceph)

		refactorings to combine build and test functions (<-ceph)

	SimCPU:	memory pressure factor ??? how to approach
	
	Gateway
		seq/random controlled by dict options
		add read-ahead option
		{create,delete}: implement in terms of MDS
		add tests for create/delete/open
		probability of needing a lock
		add getattr/setattr and tests
	
	Server
		add getattr/setattr/commit tests
		add read/modify/write

	ceph:	make mutatis mutandum list for ceph modules

	MDS ... list to come

	put a client on top of the gateway simulation
	how to scale Gateway to whole cluster throughput

REQUIRES THOUGHT


REQUIRES DISCUSSION/REVIEW

	make sure NIC model is general enough to simulate RDMA

	a more intelligent modeling of cache sizes and hit rates

DATA GATHERING
	We need to understand the observed (poor) network performance
		what is queueing delay
		what is startup latency
		what is recipient dispatch latency
		what is turn-around
		... and on the way back

	We need NOFS fio data with the block-sizes, depths, and
	characteristics of the reads and writes that will be
	done from the data storage nodes.  We will use this to
	calibrate the NOFS SimFS simulation.

	We need results from similar tests a data storage node load
	generation test, so that we can compare the simulated results
	with the actual results and refine the simulation.

SOMEDAY/LATER

	transient response simulation for NLUN-FS and node status  updates

	utilization aware load mixer
