"""
This is intended to be able to simulate disk drives with a range of
smarts.  It is probably pretty accurate with respect to random access
performance (which is dominated by physics) but only a crude approximation
for small-block sequential access (which is dominated by  caching.
Fortunately, small-block streaming is not (for us) a typical load.
